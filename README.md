# Goodmem Devcontainer

The **Goodmem Devcontainer** is a complete, zero-configuration development environment designed to get you coding instantly. It packages all necessary SDKs, tools, and extensions into a single, pre-baked container, ensuring a consistent and efficient workflow for every developer.

### What's Included ðŸ“¦

* **Languages:** Python 3.10 (with GoodMem & OpenAI SDKs), Java 17, .NET 8, Go 1.22, and Node.js 20 (with pnpm).
* **VS Code Extensions:** Pre-installed extensions for all included languages, plus essential linters and formatters.
* **Ready to Use:** Pre-configured shell access as the `vscode` user. All settings are baked into the image â€” no setup scripts needed.

### The Benefits âœ…

* **Zero Setup Time:** No need to manually install compilers, SDKs, linters, or extensions.
* **Consistency:** Everyone on the team uses the exact same environment, eliminating "it works on my machine" problems.
* **Seamless Upgrades:** Updating to a new version is as simple as changing a single line in a configuration file.
* **Reliability:** All logic is pre-baked into the image, avoiding fragile post-creation scripts that can fail.
* **Offline-Friendly:** Once the container image is pulled, you donâ€™t need an internet connection to use the environment.

## Your First Run: Setting Up and Testing GoodMem

Once your Codespace is running or you've opened the project in a local dev container, follow these steps to configure your API keys and run your first test. This entire process happens inside the VS Code environment.

#### Step 1: Create Your Environment File

You will store your secret API keys in an environment file. In the VS Code terminal (at the bottom of the editor), create a new `.env` file by running this command:

```bash
touch .env
